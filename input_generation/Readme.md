## A - National-level input generation 

## The inputs are generated at national-scale regardless of study area

### step a.1 - processing CFS zone in [cfs_to_faf_map_generation.R](cfs_to_faf_map_generation.R):
* Using input geographic data from CFS2017 (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cfs/technical-documentation/geographies.html) and CFS2017-FAF5 mapping (https://faf.ornl.gov/faf5/)
* Combine CFS county data with CFS county to metro area lookup table
* Combine CFS metro area with FAF zone
* Produce county shapefile with CFS county, metro area and FAF zone (CFS2017_areas.geojson)
  
### step a.2 - generate initial employment count per firm by firm size at national level in [employment_count_by_firm.R](employment_count_by_firm.R):
* Require CENSUS employment data by firm size (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/susb.html)
* Produce average employment per firm by firm size group  'SynthFirm_parameters/employment_by_firm_size_gapfill.csv'
* Produce average employment per firm by firm size group and industries 'SynthFirm_parameters/employment_by_firm_size_naics.csv' 
* While these two tables are not directly associated with synthetic firm output due to IPF fitting, it is needed to initiate firm synthesize and provide initial employment values.

### step a.3 - project BEA I-O table for baseline year in [BEA_IO_processor.py](BEA_IO_processor.py):
* Require BEA I-O use data from multiple years as inputs
  * 2012 I-O with 405 industries (also contains industry mapping): https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.bea.gov%2Findustry%2Fxls%2Fio-annual%2FUse_SUT_Framework_2007_2012_DET.xlsx
  * 2017 I-O with 71 industries:https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=150&step=3&isuri=1&table_list=6009&categories=io (modify year to baseline = 2017)
* For 2017 I-O, in addition to industry-specific values, it is critical to include added value (last row) during production.  This value indicates the value of commodity gained during production and paid by consumers.  Without this the final I-O will be significantly under-estimated. BEA:The sum of the entries in a column is that industryâ€™s output.
* Project 2012 I-O value to 2017 industry total, to obtain I-O values by all 405 industries
* Produce projected baseline I-O data as output 'SynthFirm_parameters/data_2017io_revised_USE_value_added.csv'

* Produce the following 5 outputs:
  * Unit cost by commodity: SynthFirm_parameters/data_unitcost_cfs2017.csv
  * Unit cost by CFS zone and commodity: SynthFirm_parameters/data_unitcost_by_zone_cfs2017.csv
  * Shipment size with pre-defined percentile cut-off criteria: SynthFirm_parameters/max_load_per_shipment_{X}percent.csv -> x is pre-defined quantile value to select max load by sctg 
  * Production/consumption value allocation factor by FAF zone: SynthFirm_parameters/producer_value_fraction_by_faf.csv AND SynthFirm_parameters/consumer_value_fraction_by_faf.csv
  * Seasonal load allocation factor by SCTG group for national freight trip generation (future work): seasonal_allocation_factor_by_sctg.csv

* Require CFS 2017 imputed data as input (CFS2017_national_forML_short.csv)
* Require unit cost estimation by zone and sctg from step a.4 (data_unitcost_by_zone_cfs2017)
* Require several predefined lookup tables:
  * CFS and FAF zone lookup from FAF5 document: CFS_FAF_LOOKUP.csv (downloaded from FAF5 website under 'Related Information': https://faf.ornl.gov/faf5/)
  * commodity SCTG group definition: SCTG_Groups_revised.csv (defined by research team)

  * SynthFirm_parameters/total_commodity_production_{forecast_year}.csv
  * SynthFirm_parameters/total_commodity_consumption_{forecast_year}.csv
* Generate unit cost by year from FAF5
  * SynthFirm_parameters/data_unitcost_by_zone_faf{forecast_year}.csv
* Generate demand growth rate for international shipping (by SCTG and year):
